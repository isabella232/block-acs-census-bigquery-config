# ACS Demographic Data Block


The U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) is an annual nationwide survey that collects and produces information on social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics in the U.S. This Data Block is based on a [publicly available dataset hosted in Google BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/united-states-census-bureau/acs?id=1282ab4c-78a4-4da5-8af8-cd693fe390ab) as part of the [Google Cloud Public Datasets Program](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets?_ga=2.233975447.-840160752.1587661252). Here we reference the most recent [5 year estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html) for each geographic region currently available in BigQuery.

You'll find two types of view files in this Data Block: those related to geography (in the `geography` folder) and those that group fields into categories like `employment` and `population` (in the `views` folder). The Census Bureau designates  `GEOID` identifiers for each geographic region. `GEOID`s are hierarchical allowing the `geographic` views to be joined via their respective `geo_id` fields to more granular levels. The premade explores included in the Data Block have already been joined in such a way.

**Please refer to [this link](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) for more detail regarding `GEOID` designations.**


### Importing ACS Data into other Projects
Views and explores from this Data Block can be brought into your other projects by using [project import](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/importing-projects) via [extends](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/extends) or [refinements](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/refinements) syntax.

If using `state`, `county` or `census_tract` geographies without joining to the `block_group` level you'll need to also include the fields of interest from the `views` folder.

All other geographic regions: `school_districts_*`, `block_group`, `cbsa`, `places`, `puma`, `congressional_district` and `zcta` include fields when imported and can be joined to `state` using the `state_key` field -- no additional `view` declarations are required -- simply import and join to an explore. Refer to the example below to help you get started.


#### Project Import Example
Imagine we have a project with an `orders` explore which we join to an `address` view that just happens to have a `county_fips` field (lucky us). We're interested in learning more about the of level of education and income for the populations of a few counties and decide to incorporate this Data Block into our original project.

The original explore looks like this:

```
explore: orders {
  join: address {
    sql_on: ${orders.address_id} = ${address.id}
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
}
```

We decide to include all the geographies and metrics from this Data Block by adding these `include` headers to our model file:

```
include: "//marketplace_block_acs_census_bigquery/geography/*"
include: "//marketplace_block_acs_census_bigquery/views/*"
```

Since we're only interested in `county` level granularity (so we are not including the most granular `block_group` geography in this project) we'll need to also select the types of fields we're interested in having access to. We can add fields to the imported `county` view by creating an additional view that extends both the relevant fields and the base `county` geography layer. We'll use that view to join everything together in the existing explore.

It'll look something like this when we're done:



```
include: "//marketplace_block_acs_census_bigquery/geography/*"
include: "//marketplace_block_acs_census_bigquery/views/*"

#Since we're not importing the block_group level, we'll populate the county level with measures
view: county_education_employment {
  extends: [county, education, employment]
}

explore: orders {
  join: address {
    sql_on: ${orders.address_id} = ${address.id}
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  #This is from the extended county view we made to populate the geography layer with measures.
  join: county_education_employment {
    sql_on: ${address.county_fips} = ${county_education_employment.county_fips}
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  #This is the imported state view. No need to populate with measures as we'll roll-up from county
  join: state {
    sql_on: ${county_education_employment.state_key} = ${state.key}
  }
}

```


Now imagine we'd simply want Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) granularity. Since ZCATs are terminal nodes in the [`GEOID` hierarchy](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf?#) we know that fields are already included in the imported view so we could simply have something like:

```
include: "//marketplace_block_acs_census_bigquery/geography/*"

explore: orders {
  join: address {
    sql_on: ${orders.address_id} = ${address.id}
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  #No additional view required since this is the terminal granularity for a ZCTA GEOID designation
  join: zcta {
    sql_on: ${address.zcta} = ${zcta.zcta}
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  #Measures from zcta view will roll-up to state level
  join: state {
    sql_on: ${zcta.state_key} = ${state.key}
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
}
```
